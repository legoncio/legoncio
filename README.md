### Hi there, I'm Leon Gonzalez (AKA legoncio) ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack web developer, focusing on Nodejs, React, Redux and Mongodb

I'm currently studying a master's degree in full stack web development at Three Points digital school and also I am learning Python with 100 days of code

You can look for me in the web by searching 'legoncio'. Is my nickname and gamertag for everything! (except for Linkedin, it doesn't sound too professional I guess...)

Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/le%C3%B3n-gonz%C3%A1lez-04354642/

You can reach me through the above profiles!

I love coding and videogames! (Not necessarily in that order)
